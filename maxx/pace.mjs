/**
 * The WEEK line's pace token — pure decision, extracted so it's testable (render.mjs
 * runs main() and reads homedir() at import, so it can't be unit-tested in place).
 *
 * The week line answers ONE question: am I over? The "X left" token already answers it
 * (left > 0 → not over). This SECOND token is a PACE signal only: the even-pace bank,
 * cap×elapsed − used = how far ahead of / behind a straight-line burn through the week.
 *
 * It used to render as the word "over" in RED — the same word and colour the real,
 * fleet-halting cap verdict uses. So a −3.6M pace wobble against a 289M week (1.3%, pure
 * noise) read as "you breached your weekly cap" while 91% of the tank was still there.
 * That is the exact confusion that made the week status unreadable on 2026-07-24.
 *
 * Rules, so that can't happen again:
 *  - never the word "over" — "ahead pace" / "behind pace" (over belongs to the verdict);
 *  - behind pace is AMBER, not RED — RED is reserved for the actual over-budget verdict;
 *  - dead-banded: a deviation under 5% of the weekly cap is even-pace noise → show nothing.
 *
 * bankTokens and capTokens are in the same units. Returns null when nothing should render.
 * `pct` is the deviation as a signed whole-percent of the weekly cap — the compact display
 * unit ("−9%"): the raw k-magnitude ("−60,323k behind pace") was long AND meaningless to a
 * human, where "9% behind an even burn" is instantly legible in a third the width.
