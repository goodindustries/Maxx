# Maxx connector — deploy + wire-up

## Self-serve — anyone can use the hosted server

One account = one **handle** + one **secret**, minted once at signup (first come,
first served). Everything is per-handle: your own tally, budget, feed, and the
budget-gate rules ship automatically to every agent that carries your connector.
Every Claude account keeps its own timeline — there is no global one.

Three ways to sign up (all hit `POST /api/signup`):
- **Web:** meetmaxx.co → "Track every machine & cloud session" → claim a handle,
  the connector URL is shown once in the browser.
- **Zero-input CLI:** `node ~/.claude/skills/maxx/emit.mjs --signup` (no handle)
  derives the handle from the signed-in Claude login and binds the account uuid.
- **Named CLI:** `--signup <handle>` as below.

```bash
# 1. install the statusline + skill (also places emit.mjs/watch.mjs)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/goodindustries/Maxx/main/maxx/install.sh | bash

# 2. claim your handle (writes ~/.maxx/config.json, prints your connector URL)
node ~/.claude/skills/maxx/emit.mjs --signup <your-handle>

# 3. live-ship this machine's usage at login (launchd on macOS)
node ~/.claude/skills/maxx/emit.mjs --install-agent
```

Then add the printed URL as a custom connector (claude.ai → Settings →
Connectors → Add custom connector, name `Maxx`):
`https://api.meetmaxx.co/mcp?handle=<you>&k=<secret>`. Any agent (cloud routine,
claude.ai chat, another machine) with that connector gets the budget-gate
`instructions` on initialize and can call `maxx_emit` / `maxx_budget` against
**your** account only.

Your own eyes: `node ~/.claude/skills/maxx/watch.mjs` (live dashboard) ·
`tail -f ~/.maxx/emit.log` (shipper log) ·
`GET /api/u/<you>/feed?n=50` (server-side event feed).

### The hard gate (PreToolUse deny)

The connector's `instructions` are advisory. install.sh also wires the HARD gate:
a PreToolUse hook (`gate.mjs`) that DENIES expensive spawns (Agent / Task /
Workflow / ScheduleWakeup / CronCreate) when the tally says `over`/`stale`/
`session_to_spend 0`. Fail-closed: no fresh verdict = deny. Cloud routines honor
repo `.claude/settings.json` hooks, so to enforce in cloud add to the repo:

```json
{ "hooks": { "PreToolUse": [ { "matcher": "Agent|Task|Workflow",
  "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "node maxx/gate.mjs", "timeout": 10 }] } ] } }
```

Toggle at agent level — any session's user can overturn, but it's RECORDED
(local `~/.maxx/gate.log` + a `⚠ GATE OVERTURNED` event in the central feed):

```bash
node ~/.claude/skills/maxx/gate.mjs --status
node ~/.claude/skills/maxx/gate.mjs --overturn "shipping a prod hotfix"   # off, noted
node ~/.claude/skills/maxx/gate.mjs --on                                  # re-enable, noted
```

The secret is shown once at signup and stored only in `~/.maxx/config.json` —
treat it like a password (it's a rotatable metadata token; no content ever
leaves the machine, only token counts). Signup endpoint: `POST /api/signup
{"handle":"you"}`.

## LIVE NOW — api.meetmaxx.co (CF-direct) on lucky (hardware)

Routing: `api.meetmaxx.co → Cloudflare (proxied) → lucky named tunnel → server`.
No Netlify in the API path (confirmed by `cf-ray` header). meetmaxx.co (Netlify,
`site/`) serves the **landing page only** — `/mcp` there is 404 by design.

- **Connector URL: `https://api.meetmaxx.co/mcp?handle=reif_tgp`** (Bearer). One
  handle per Claude ACCOUNT — every account has its own timeline, there is no
  global one. `reif` = the retired account's frozen tally; `reif_tgp` = the
  reif@thegoodproject.net account (active since 2026-07-20). The laptop's
  account ledger (`~/.maxx/accounts.json`, maintained by `limit.mjs`) marks
  which account owns which slice of the local logs.
- **CF DNS:** proxied CNAME `api.meetmaxx.co` → `51665939-…​.cfargotunnel.com` in the
  meetmaxx.co zone (needs a CF token with Zone:DNS:Edit on meetmaxx.co — lucky's
  tunnel cert only covers luckymachines.co).
- **lucky tunnel ingress** (`~/.cloudflared/config.yml`): `api.meetmaxx.co →
  http://127.0.0.1:8791`, before the 404 catch-all. Reload with SIGHUP to the
  `cloudflared tunnel run lucky` process (`config.yml.bak-premaxx` is the backup).

Behind the tunnel — the server itself:

- **Server:** `node server/serve.mjs --port 8791` as lucky job (queue:false daemon),
  cwd `/home/agent/maxxbudget` (shallow clone of the `maxx-budget` branch),
  state `/home/agent/maxxbudget-state`, `MAXX_SECRET` from `…-state/.secret`.
- **Reverse proxy:** `site_deploy name=maxxbudget target=8791` — the `/maxxbudget`
  prefix is stripped before the upstream, so routes are clean.
- **Public base:** `https://luckymachines.co/maxxbudget`
  - MCP connector URL: `https://luckymachines.co/maxxbudget/mcp?handle=reif`
  - emit / budget: `…/maxxbudget/api/u/reif/{logs,budget}`
- **Laptop:** `~/.maxx/config.json` → `logsUrl=https://luckymachines.co/maxxbudget`,
  matching `secret`. Continuous ship via launchd agent `co.meetmaxx.emit`
  (`emit.mjs --watch`, logs `~/.maxx/emit.log`).
- **Redeploy after a code change:** push to `maxx-budget`, then on lucky
  `git -C /home/agent/maxxbudget pull && systemctl --user restart maxx-tally`.
- **Durable:** systemd user unit `maxx-tally.service` supervises the server
  (auto-restarts, survives reboot) — do NOT kill the pid or start a lucky job
  for it; the unit respawns in seconds and a second copy just hits EADDRINUSE.
  Secret is a rotatable metadata token.

The account-wide **Maxx** connector is how every Claude Code cloud routine reports
its token burn to the central tally (and reads budget back). It's a standard
custom MCP connector added through Claude's official connector setup — one MCP
endpoint that also serves the laptop's REST emit. Both talk the [LOGS.md](../maxx/LOGS.md)
contract to one per-handle store.

Why a connector and not a repo skill: a skill only exists in routines that clone
that repo; a connector is attached once to your claude.ai account and reaches
**every** session you enable it on, regardless of repo. It must include the cloud
routines or their burn is invisible — and a missing surface biases the tally
optimistically (see [[maxx-cloud-cannot-self-derive-budget]]).

## 1. Deploy the server (meetmaxx.co, Netlify)

The server is transport-agnostic; the Netlify wrapper is `server/netlify-fn.mjs`.

1. Place `server/netlify-fn.mjs` in the site's functions dir (e.g.
   `netlify/functions/maxx.mjs`) with `handler.mjs` / `tally.mjs` / `store.mjs`
   reachable by its imports; ensure `@netlify/blobs` is available.
2. Set env in Netlify: `MAXX_SECRET` (shared bearer) or `MAXX_SECRET_<HANDLE>`
   (per user, e.g. `MAXX_SECRET_REIF`). This must match the `secret` in the
   laptop's `~/.maxx/config.json`.
3. Deploy (manual, per project convention): `netlify deploy --prod --dir site …`.
4. Verify: `curl https://meetmaxx.co/health` → `{"ok":true,"service":"maxx-tally"}`.

Endpoints once live:
- `POST /api/u/{handle}/logs` · `GET /api/u/{handle}/budget` (laptop emit)
- `POST /mcp` (the connector; Streamable HTTP / JSON-RPC 2.0)

## 2. Add the official connector in Claude

claude.ai → **Settings → Connectors → Add custom connector**:
- **Name:** `Maxx`
- **URL:** `https://meetmaxx.co/mcp?handle=<yourhandle>` (the `handle` query pins
  the budget owner; alternatively pass `handle` in each tool call's arguments)
- **Auth:** Bearer — the same secret as the server env / laptop config.

It exposes two tools:
- `maxx_emit({ surface, sessions[], anchor? })` — report usage metadata (counts
  only). Cloud routines leave `anchor` unset (they can't read /usage).
- `maxx_budget()` — read the omni-surface budget to gate spend.

## 3. Enable it on the routines + gate on it

For each cloud routine (claude.ai/code/routines → the routine → connectors),
include **Maxx**, and update the routine prompt:

- **Report burn** (so the tally is complete): near the end of the run, and at
  checkpoints in a long run, call `maxx_emit` with `surface:"cloud:<routine>"` and
  a `sessions` entry carrying the output tokens generated this run (best-effort;
  the anchor trues it up). This is the live-stream from cloud.
- **Gate on the central budget** instead of the laptop-fed dashboard: replace the
  `curl …/api/pm/board … signals.budget` gate with a `maxx_budget()` call, and
  apply the same FAIL-CLOSED rule on `verdict` in `("over","stale")` /
  `session_to_spend == 0`.

## 4. Keep the laptop shipping (the anchor source)

The laptop is the only surface that carries the authoritative `/usage` anchor.
Keep it streaming:
- one-shot: `node maxx/emit.mjs --send` (cron/launchd every few minutes), or
- live: `node maxx/emit.mjs --watch` (tails `.jsonl` appends, ships each turn as
  it lands during a running session).

Config in `~/.maxx/config.json`: `handle`, `secret`, `installId`, `logsUrl`
(default `https://meetmaxx.co`). Cursor in `~/.maxx/emit-cursor.json`.
